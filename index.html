                    <p> Deep learning has achieved great success in a variety of tasks such as recognizing objects in images, predicting the sentiment of sentences, or speech synthesis by training on a large-amount of data. However, most of existing success are mainly focusing on perceptual tasks, which is also known as System I reasoning. In real world, many tasks are much more complicated such as autonomous driving, public policy decision making, and multi-hop question answering, which requires understanding the relationship between high-level variables in the data to perform logical reasoning, which is known as System II reasoning. </p>

                    <p>Graph Neural Networks is a powerful tool for representation learning for graph problems. It has recently emerge as a tool for connecting deep learning with logic reasoning and graph algorithms. XXX used graph neural networks for logic inference, XXX used graph neural networks visual questions reasoning, XXX used graph neural networks for graph algorithms, Graph neural networks have become a tool beyond classification and link prediction, and </p>

                    <p>The goal of this workshop is to bring researchers from deep learning, logic inference, and graph algorithms into a common roof to explore the confluence of ideas in previously separate field. </p>
                    <p>Learning and reasoning with graph-structured representations is gaining increasing interest in both academia and industry, due to its fundamental advantages over more traditional unstructured methods in supporting interpretability, causality, and transferability / inductive generalization. Recently, there is a surge of new techniques in the context of deep learning, such as graph neural networks, for learning graph representations and performing reasoning and prediction, which have achieved impressive progress. However, it can still be a long way to go to obtain satisfactory results in long-range multi-step reasoning, scalable learning with very large graphs, flexible modeling of graphs in combination with other dimensions such as temporal variation and other modalities such as language and vision. New advances in theoretical foundations, models and algorithms, as well as empirical discoveries and applications are therefore all highly desirable. The aims of this workshop are to bring together researchers to dive deeply into some of the most promising methods which are under active exploration today, discuss how we can design new and better benchmarks, identify impactful application domains, encourage discussion and foster collaboration. </p>
